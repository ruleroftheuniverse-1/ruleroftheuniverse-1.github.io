  <h1>Writing</h1>

  <h2>Glossary of Personhood (2025–in progress)</h2>
  <p>A formalized, geometry-inspired conceptual framework for understanding selfhood across biological and artificial systems. This glossary is part of a larger attempt to systematize identity using rigorous yet accessible models.</p>

  <h2>Philosophical Counseling Series</h2>
  <p>Writings that develop a unique model of philosophical support for high-functioning, conceptually intense clients. Focused on care ethics, agency repair, and clarity under pressure.</p>

  <h2>Essays on Mind, Ethics, and Meaning</h2>
  <p>Public-facing Substack essays blending personal narrative with theory, exploring topics like dissociation, self-construction, and long-term decision architectures. These works often straddle the line between memoir and speculative philosophy.</p>

  <h2>Academic and Independent Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GitHub-based writing (2024–present):</strong> Code-linked concept exploration and simulation-based philosophy</li>
    <li><strong>Op-eds and blog posts:</strong> In-progress revisions of informal writings into structured white papers</li>
  </ul>
